# DRLWorkbench
1. Backtesting Framework — Walk-forward validation, rolling windows, transaction costs, slippage modeling (from Code_Skills pt2/pt3 patterns of realistic portfolio simulation).  2. Regime Analysis — Detect bull/bear/sideways markets; compute regime-conditioned metrics (Sharpe by regime, max DD by regime); use for strategy comparison.  3. Error Handling & Logging — Comprehensive try-catch blocks, graceful degradation (API fallback to cache), checkpointing for resume capability. Custom exceptions and centralized logging.  4. Data Validation — New validator module checking for stationarity (ADF test), data leakage, outliers, multicollinearity—catching issues before they corrupt models.  5. Hyperparameter Tuning — Systematic grid search + random search with early stopping (inspired by deep learning file pt1's hyperparameter sweep).  6. Comparative Strategy Analysis — Side-by-side comparison across all portfolio methods; sensitivity analysis (±10% parameter sweep); performance attribution (Barra-style timing/selection analysis).  7. Ensemble Models — Framework for combining multiple forecasters/DRL agents for robustness.  8. Enhanced Visualizations — Equity curves with regime backgrounds, rolling metrics, strategy comparison dashboard, regime performance heatmaps, model diagnostics (residuals, calibration).  9. Professional Reporting — PDF/HTML/CSV export (automated formatting, not just raw data).
